# Lessons Learned Template

This document captures lessons learned from using different programming languages in our project.

## Language 1: Go

### What Did We Learn About This Language?
- Go provides excellent concurrency support with goroutines, making it easy to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
- Its simplicity and strict typing reduce bugs during runtime.
- The Go module system (`go mod`) simplifies dependency management.

### Interesting Problems Encountered
- Error handling in Go is verbose and can lead to boilerplate code.
- Limited standard library features compared to some other languages required reliance on third-party packages.
- Debugging issues with goroutines can be challenging if proper logging isn't implemented.

## Language 2: Ruby

### What Did We Learn About This Language?
- Ruby's syntax is intuitive and developer-friendly, promoting rapid development and ease of use.
- The flexibility of Ruby allows for metaprogramming, which can reduce boilerplate code.
- The Sinatra framework is lightweight and effective for building simple APIs.

### Interesting Problems Encountered
- Performance can become an issue with Ruby, especially for CPU-intensive tasks.
- Debugging can be tricky due to Ruby's dynamic typing and metaprogramming capabilities.
- Dependency conflicts between gems occasionally caused issues during development.

## Language 3: JavaScript

### What Did We Learn About This Language?
- JavaScript is highly versatile, enabling development on both front-end (e.g., React) and back-end (e.g., Node.js).
- Its asynchronous nature with promises and `async/await` improves responsiveness in web applications.
- A vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks speeds up development.

### Interesting Problems Encountered
- Callback hell was an issue before refactoring to use `async/await`.
- Debugging issues related to implicit type coercion and loose equality (`==` vs `===`).
- Managing state in complex front-end applications was challenging without a clear structure (e.g., Redux or Context API).

## General Reflections

### Key Takeaways
- Each language has strengths suited to specific tasks: Go for performance-critical and concurrent systems, Ruby for rapid prototyping and small APIs, and JavaScript for its ubiquity in web development.
- Choosing the right language for the task significantly impacts development efficiency and scalability.
- Familiarity with frameworks and libraries for each language is essential to fully leverage their capabilities.

### Future Improvements
- For future projects, we can streamline debugging processes by standardizing logging and error-handling patterns across languages.
- Conduct a deeper evaluation of language suitability for tasks before starting development to minimize later refactoring.
- Encourage cross-training within the team to ensure familiarity with different languages and frameworks, reducing dependency on specialized developers.
